<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Background</span></h2>
<p>The Parthenon of Pericles, while not thought to be
one of the wonders of the world, nevertheless has always
been regarded as one of the most wondrously beautiful
and inspiring of the world&rsquo;s buildings. It embraces
the best effort of the mind, the heart, and the
hand of man. In it are bound up the religion, the history,
and the art of Greece.</p>
<p>It has been well said that art is organized emotion,
while science is organized knowledge. The field of emotion
found its first great development among the Greeks
and in the time of Pericles reached its zenith. Assuredly
the Greeks have never been excelled in the beauty of
their architecture or sculptural art.</p>
<p>The influence of religion was dominant in the life
and thought that produced such outstanding men in
this period of world history as Phidias and Sophocles,
Ictinos and Pericles. Every function of the mind, every
activity of the hand, was closely associated with some
god or goddess, and to this inspirational incentive the
world is greatly indebted for the Parthenon. The
mythological stories of the Parthenon largely cover the
mythology of Greece. Twenty-eight of the major deities
and numerous minor deities and personifications adorn
its pediments.</p>
<p>At the time of its destruction in the seventeenth century,
a little more than two thousand years after its
completion, the Parthenon was almost in as good condition
as it was at its beginning. The changes made by the
Christians in the fifth century and by the Turks in the
fifteenth century had impaired it but little, all of which
is eloquent testimony to the thoroughness with which
the task was accomplished. The co-ordination of mind,
hand, and heart of the Greeks of that age has never been
excelled by men of any time and found its culmination
in the Parthenon.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Ruins of the Parthenon at Athens in 1929</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">The Parthenon at Athens</span></h2>
<p>The Parthenon was built on the Acropolis, a
hill two hundred feet above the streets of
Athens, in the year 438 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Not yet had the
blight of decay laid its hand upon an outstanding
civilization and Athens was at the zenith of
her glory and power. The nations she had conquered
contributed to her wealth and her slaves
furnished the labor for her every great undertaking.
It is no wonder that at this time
she should turn her heart toward her beloved
Athena and honor her with a shrine. Athena
Parthenos was her name, hence the word Parthenon.
She was the wisest and most beautiful of
the Grecian deities and the Parthenon was her
temple.</p>
<p>It is thought that the earliest Greeks worshiped
their goddess with crude altars of uncut
stone and unhewn wood. Gradually, as the
Greeks became more intelligent, they began
building temples, each lovelier than the one before
and all on the same foundation, as attested
by excavations at Athens. It is not known just
how many temples there were in this series, but
it is known that the last one was destroyed by
the Persian Xerxes in the year 480 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Then
came the Parthenon, begun in 447 and dedicated
to the goddess Athena in 438 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Here for a
thousand years the Greeks worshiped their goddess,
and it was during this period that Greece
produced the greatest of her philosophers, warriors,
artists, and writers.</p>
<p>The Parthenon was built under the supervision
of Phidias, the greatest artist of form the
world has ever known. He was a close friend
of Pericles, archon of Athens, who, appreciating
Phidias&rsquo; great executive ability as well as his
genius, commissioned him to build the temple.
He had built a number of other temples for
Pericles, notably the temple of Zeus at Olympia,
but the Parthenon was the most ambitious of all
his undertakings, as indeed it was the most ambitious
of all the Greek temples.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>The Greeks were somewhat slow in embracing
Christianity but by 426 <span class="small">A.D.</span> they had become a
Christian nation. In the meantime Greece had
fallen under the dominion of the Roman Empire
and the Emperor Theodosius II changed
the Parthenon into a Christian church. For a
little more than a thousand years the Greeks
worshiped Jehovah in the Parthenon. After
the conquest by the Turks in 1458 the Parthenon
was changed into a Mohammedan mosque.</p>
<p>Except for the minor changes to the interior
in the fifth century by the Christians and those
to the exterior in the fifteenth century by the
Turks, the Parthenon was almost in as good
condition at the time of its destruction in 1687
as it was in the beginning. In that year the
Turks were driven out of Athens by the Venetians,
representing a Christian nation. In this
war the Turks temporarily stored gunpowder in
the Parthenon for safekeeping, thinking the
Greek gods which adorned its pediments would
give them good luck. However, a Venetian
shot, not so respectful of the gods of the Greeks,
struck the Parthenon and rendered it the interesting
ruin that, for the most part, remains
today.</p>
<p>As a result of the explosion the entire interior
was destroyed. The columns, the architrave,
the ceiling, the roof, nothing remained except
the floor and fragments of the walls. Fortunately
the explosive agent was gunpowder,
whose power acts upward and outward only;
consequently, the floor was not materially injured
and the markings on the floor disclose the
order of architecture, location, and diameter of
the columns.</p>
<p>The exterior did not suffer as much from the
force of the explosion as did the interior. Of
the fifty-eight columns on the outside, forty-four
were left standing. Eight on the northeast
corner and six on the south side were entirely
blown away. A few of the end columns were
damaged slightly. Almost all of the pedimental
sculptures were blown off and greatly injured.
Only two fragmentary groups of the pedimental
sculptures are left on the old ruin.</p>
<p>In 1929 the Greek Government, with the assistance
of American capital, began a restoration
of the Parthenon. It is to be hoped that the
Greeks will not allow anything to prevent the
completion of this work.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Parthenon at Nashville at Night</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">The Parthenon at Nashville</span></h2>
<p>In 1896 the State of Tennessee attained its
full century statehood. To celebrate that important
event in the life of the State the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition was held in Nashville
the following year. Nashville had long
been known as the &ldquo;Athens of the South&rdquo; because
of its many schools and colleges and accompanying
culture, and it is not surprising that
the director general of the exposition, a man
noted for his culture and love of art, conceived
the idea of having as the gallery of fine arts for
the exposition a reproduction of the Parthenon
at Athens.</p>
<p>In the successful prosecution of the work
there was no time for research and study. Relying
on existing information, a very creditable
building was erected of laths and plaster in the
few months available.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Gallery of Fine Arts&rdquo; attracted so much
favorable attention during the exposition that at
its close the people of Nashville, having become
greatly attached to it, insisted that it should not
be torn down when the exposition buildings
were destroyed. The Board of Park Commissioners
of the City of Nashville obtained approximately
one hundred and fifty acres of land
surrounding the building and laid out what is
now beautiful Centennial Park. Built to last a
year, the much loved building stood for nearly
twenty-four years until, in spite of every effort
made for its preservation, it became a greater
ruin than its prototype in Athens.</p>
<p>The Board of Park Commissioners had long
had as a cherished objective the reproduction of
the Parthenon in permanent materials. This
was an ambitious undertaking for a city much
larger than Nashville, and it was not until 1920
that the old building was torn down and on its
site the present reproduction of the Parthenon
at Athens was begun. Competent architects,
artists, and archaeologists were employed, who
devoted the best efforts of their careers to the
work. No effort was too great, no money was
spared, to make the Parthenon as near as was
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
humanly possible a reproduction of the original
as it existed as the temple of Athena in the fifth
century, <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<p>The chief difference between the original and
the reproduction lies in the materials of which
they were made. The Parthenon at Athens was
built of Pentelic marble quarried near by, while
that at Nashville is of reinforced concrete finished
by a patented process which, under the
influence of electric lights, very closely resembles
marble. The Pentelic marble of the original
had a small content of iron, which became oxidized
and the color of the ruin at Athens is
now a brownish yellow from the iron oxide
stain.</p>
<p>By the use of concrete in the building at
Nashville three important advantages were obtained:
durability, economy, and the privilege
of seeing the Parthenon in two colors. Concrete
is the most durable of all building materials
and the most economical. By a careful
selection of materials, the color of the Parthenon
at Nashville in daylight is brownish yellow, the
same as the ruin at Athens. This effect was
obtained by using, as the aggregate of the concrete,
a brownish yellow gravel from the bottom
of the Potomac River in Virginia.</p>
<p>The Parthenon at Nashville is floodlighted for
an hour and a half each night and is indeed a
beautiful sight, one of the most beautiful in the
world; the lighting plan having been carefully
designed by the Engineering Staff of the General
Electric Company. A writer in one of the leading
newspapers in America said, &ldquo;If I am ever
so fortunate as to reach the Pearly Gates of the
New Jerusalem, I shall expect to find nothing
more radiantly beautiful than the Parthenon at
Nashville at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is regretted that there was no acropolis on
which to locate the reproduction in Nashville.
However, this defect in the setting was to some
extent atoned for by building it adjacent to a
small lake and surrounding it with a beautiful
park.</p>
<p>The Parthenon at Athens had no basement,
but in the reproduction a basement was added
to house a museum of fine arts. Thus the spirit
of the Parthenon, always a temple of some god,
is not violated by the hanging of pictures on its
walls.</p>
<p>Begun in 1920, because of the research necessary
to make it a reproduction of the original as
it was in the beginning, the Parthenon at Nashville
required eleven years for completion. The
exterior was finished in 1925, and the Parthenon
was thrown open to the public on May 20, 1931,
six years having been necessary to complete the
interior.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Description of the Parthenon</span></h2>
<p>The Parthenon of Pericles has been shown in
a new light as a result of the eleven years of
study and research made in connection with the
reproduction at Nashville. Some of the older
conceptions were based on assumptions rather
than facts derived from research. For the first
time the modern Greek who visits Nashville
sees the Parthenon as his ancestors saw and admired
it at Athens.</p>
<p>The Parthenon is sixty-five feet high with its
superstructure resting on the base or stylobate
of the temple, consisting of three steps. The
largest dimensions are furnished by the lowest
of these steps, which is two hundred and thirty-eight
feet long by one hundred and eleven feet
wide. The top step, on which the peristyle
rests, is two hundred and twenty-eight feet long
by one hundred and one feet wide.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting peculiarities, or it
might be said subtleties, employed by the Greeks
in building the Parthenon is that no two major
lines are exactly parallel nor are they exactly
equal in length.</p>
<p>The most striking feature of the Parthenon
when viewed from any exterior approach is the
encircling row of great Doric columns forming
the peristyle. There are forty-six of these
columns, seventeen on each side, six on each end
(not counting the corner columns twice), and
six each on the east and west porticos. The
columns of the peristyle are thirty-four feet
high with an approximate diameter at the base
of six feet. They have an average spacing from
face to face of eight feet. The columns of the
porticos are somewhat smaller, having a base
diameter of five and one-half feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/pw05.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="800" />
<p class="pcap">Top of Treasury or West Room Showing Ionic Columns and Decorations</p>
</div>
<p>The main body of the building is called the
cella. The exterior walls of the cella on the
long sides with the columns form majestic corridors.
The shadows falling at certain times of
the day on the walls and floors of the corridors
are very beautiful.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature connected with
the corridors is what has come to be known as
the &ldquo;Greek Urn.&rdquo; This is the figure cut in the
sky by the columns and architrave at the ends
of the long exterior corridors. The Greek Urn
has been made famous in literature by the poet
Keats in his &ldquo;Ode to a Grecian Urn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only openings to the Parthenon are the
two pairs of great bronze doors leading off the
east and west porticos. These doors are the
largest in America and probably are the largest
bronze doors in the world. They can only be
challenged as to size by the Congressional Library
doors at Washington or by those of one of
the old cathedrals in Florence, Italy, and they
are slightly larger than either. The doors are
twenty-four feet high, seven feet each wide, a
foot thick, and weight seven and one-half tons
each.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the front entrance to
the Parthenon was through the eastern doors.
If there were no documentary evidence to prove
this, and there is an abundance, the fact that all
of the twenty-two gods of the east pediment
are major deities of the Greeks while only four
of those on the west pediment are major (the
remainder being personifications and minor
deities) would be sufficient proof that the eastern
end was the front of the building.</p>
<p>Entering the Parthenon through the eastern
doors, the visitor most likely would first note the
division of the main body of the building, or
cella, by a transverse wall into two rooms&mdash;the
east room and the west room.</p>
<p>The east room is known as the Naos or temple
proper. It is ninety-eight feet long, sixty-three
feet wide, and has a ceiling height of forty-three
feet. The most striking feature of the Naos is
the double row of Doric columns, twenty-three
below and twenty-three above, with an architrave
between. These form a colonnade surrounding
the main floor on three sides. The
lower units of the colonnade are three and three-quarter
feet in diameter at the base and twenty-one
feet high. Those of the upper tier are two
and one-quarter feet in diameter and sixteen
feet high. The columns on the long side of the
colonnade form with the interior cella walls
beautiful and impressive corridors. Another
interesting feature is that the floor of the corridors
is raised an inch and a half above the main
floor of the Naos.</p>
<p>In the west end of the Naos, twenty feet from
the end columns and facing the eastern doors,
stood the Chryselephantine Statue of Athena,
the beautiful shrine of the temple, if historians
of that day are to be believed. The statue was
forty feet high and reached within three feet of
the ceiling. It was made, as its name indicates,
of gold and ivory. The fleshy parts were carved
ivory and the remainder were plates of gold
suspended on a framework of cedarwood. It
was the masterpiece of Phidias and was worth a
king&rsquo;s ransom.</p>
<p>When Theodosius II changed the Parthenon
into a Christian church in the fifth century he
moved the statue of Athena to Byzantium, capital
of the Roman Empire, as it would have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
incongruous to leave it in the Parthenon after
the change in religions. After the removal of
the Chryselephantine Statue its fate is shrouded
in mystery. No part of it and no authentic
sketch, drawing, or model of it has ever been
found.</p>

<p class="pcap">Interior of Naos or East Room of Parthenon at Nashville Showing the Ceiling and Plaster Casts
of Elgin Marbles</p>
</div>
<p>The Greeks entered the eastern doors at the
hour of temple worship, always in the early
morning, bearing gifts of gold and silver and
other valuable articles. There they were met
by the priests, who received the gifts. While
the worshipers paid their devotions to the goddess
at her shrine, the priests took the gifts
through the great doors, thence along the exterior
corridors, through the western doors, and
into the west room where the gifts were deposited.
This room is called the Maiden&rsquo;s
Chamber or Treasury.</p>
<p>The west room is forty-four feet long and
sixty-three feet wide. As in the east room, its
most striking feature is the columns. There
are four of these arranged in a rectangle sixteen
by twenty-three feet in the center of the room.
The columns are Ionic in design and, unlike
those of the east room, are monoliths. They are
forty-one feet high, six feet in diameter at the
base, and three and one-half feet in diameter
at the top. The decorations of the room are
Ionic also, in contrast with those of the east
room.</p>
<p>The decorations of the Parthenon are all
authenticated. Fragments of them are preserved
in the British Museum and in the Louvre, and
some of the colors still show, though dimly, on
the protected parts of the ruin at Athens. The
decorations at the top of both the interior and
exterior architrave, above and between the capitals
of the Doric columns are technically known
as guttae. The color decorations are principally
in shades of blue and red with some yellows.
In the interior the colors are found in the fret
along the top of the architrave in the east room
and in the moldings around the ceilings of both
rooms. The colors of the exterior occur in the
frets around the top of the cella walls, in the
ceiling of the corridors and porticos, and in the
decorations of the cornice.</p>
<p>The Greeks lighted the old temple almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
wholly through the great doors in each end of
the building; at Nashville the lighting comes
from above, and this is one of the most prominent
of the modern innovations incorporated in
the reproduction of the Parthenon. The Greek
ceiling was exactly like that at Nashville with
this exception: In the Greek temple, between
the great cedar beams that span the ceiling and
support the roof was an open grillwork of cedarwood,
while at Nashville the open spaces have
been filled with frosted panes of glass, etched to
resemble the rays of the sun. The Greeks might
have had glass, as the manufacture of plate glass
by the Phoenicians antedated the period of
Pericles by some five hundred years. As we
have seen, however, they had no incentive to
use it, for they obtained their light from below.
The incentive at Nashville is to conceal the two
hundred and seventy-two high-powered electric
lights which give to the interior its beautiful
simulation of sunlight, accentuating its beauty
and, to a great extent, eliminating the shadows.</p>
<p>The roof at Nashville is like the one at Athens
except as to the material used in its construction.
The antefixes along the eaves served the purpose
of covering the joints between the marble slabs
and are of carved ornamental design. At each
corner of the roof is a lion&rsquo;s head, thought to be
intended originally as a waterspout. Also at
each corner of the roof is a stone block upon
which is surmounted a Gryphon monster, standing
guard over the temple day and night. The
highest points on the Parthenon are the carved
ornaments, known as the Acroteria, at each end
of the building above the pediments.</p>
<p>It is difficult for anyone to describe the Parthenon
and do it justice. Suffice it to say that
&ldquo;it is a thing of beauty and a joy forever.&rdquo;</p>

the Elgin Marbles</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">The Architecture of the Parthenon</span></h2>
<p>The architecture of Greece was essentially
Doric. The Ionic was an exotic in Athens and
the Corinthian was more Roman than Grecian
and found no place in the Parthenon. There
is a total of one hundred and eight columns in
the building, and of these all on the exterior
and all in the east room, one hundred and four
in number, are Doric, while the four in the west
room are Ionic.</p>
<p>Taste varies in the beauty of architecture as
well as in art generally. Some admire the Gothic
cathedrals of Europe, others admire the Taj
Mahal in India, and still others prefer the temples
of Japan; but to those who admire the
architecture of the Greeks and the Romans, the
Parthenon is the most beautiful building in the
world. Regardless, however, of what may be
thought of the beauty of its architecture, it is
the most perfect.</p>
<p>The age of Pericles has been known through
the centuries as the &ldquo;Golden Age of Greece,&rdquo;
but the judgment of time has forced us to the
conclusion that it was also the golden age of the
world as far as the beauty of architecture and
sculptural art is concerned.</p>
<p>There is no more intriguing part of the whole
narrative of the Parthenon than this story of
the subtlety of the Greeks in overcoming optical
illusions and neutralizing differences in distance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important, certainly the
most prominent, of the refinements of the Parthenon
is the curvature of the horizontal lines.
It is not true, as some textbooks have it, that
there is no straight line in the Parthenon. There
are a number of them, but all of these straight
lines are vertical. What should be said is that
there are no straight horizontal lines in the
Parthenon.</p>
<p>Another refinement used by the Greeks in
adding to the beauty of the Parthenon relates
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
to the columns. The visitor is certain to be impressed
by the softness of the Doric columns.
This is especially true of those of the Naos where
their proximity to each other emphasizes their
beauty as they are caught banked against each
other. When thus seen all other columns fail by
comparison and seem as stiff as pokers. This
quality of softness is given them by the fact
that all columns, both in the Naos and on the
exterior of the building, are different in diameter
from those beside them and all are also spaced
differently.</p>
<p>Still another refinement pertaining to the
columns is technically known as entasis, which
is that quality which gives to them their beautiful
symmetry.</p>
<p>In discussing the columns in relation to their
softness it was suggested that they be seen
banked against each other. In the discovery of
their symmetrical beauty, however, they should
be seen singly. The column apparently rises
from the floor at its largest diameter and gradually
diminishes in a beautifully fluted shaft,
having the very breath of symmetry in every
line to the top. That is the way it appears; but,
as a matter of fact, if the column had been constructed
as it actually looks, then, instead of
seeming beautifully symmetrical, because of an
optical illusion, it would have appeared concave
at a point just below the center of the column.
Knowing this from experience, the Greeks filled
in just enough to correct the results of the optical
illusion and the column in reality is bulged
near the center.</p>
<p>It has been noted that the first sight of the
Parthenon usually inspires the visitor with a
sense of its strength and stability. This effect is
produced by another of the subtleties of the
Greeks in approaching perfection in the Parthenon.
Only one with technical knowledge would
ever suspect that its columns and walls are other
than perpendicular; yet, with the exception of
the transverse wall which divides the cella into
its two rooms, all of them are inclined toward
the center. If all were projected on their axes,
they would meet in a cluster five thousand,
eight hundred and fifty-six feet above the base
of the temple.</p>
<p>One of the major problems that confronted
the builders of the Parthenon at Nashville related
to the arrangement of the columns of the
Naos. Prior to the research work in connection
with the Nashville reproduction, the preponderance
of authority favored the theory that the
Doric columns of the Naos were monoliths.
This matter was settled definitely by the work
done by Mr. William Bell Dinsmoor, of New
York, who represented the builders in the
archaeological end of the work.</p>
<p>As has been said, nothing remained of the
interior of the original Parthenon after the explosion
of 1687 except the floor and fragments
of the walls. One of these fragments happened
to be in the end of the building in the southeast
corner of the Naos. Sticking in it, Mr. Dinsmoor
discovered a small piece of the architrave
and a discoloration of the wall revealing where
the remainder had been. This discovery fixed
the fact of an architrave and, following very
closely, the further fact that there were columns
superimposed on each other with an architrave
between.</p>
<p>The architecture of the Parthenon will always
carry with it elements of the mystical and the
mysterious to modern minds, accustomed as they
are to the solution of engineering problems by
rule. The more the Parthenon is considered, the
more interesting it seems.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">The Sculptures of the Parthenon</span></h2>
<p>The sculptures of the Parthenon occur in four
groups: the Ionic or inner frieze, the Doric or
outer frieze, the east pediment, and the west
pediment.</p>
<p>As the subtlety of the builders of the Parthenon
emphasized their intellect, so the sculptures
emphasized their religion. The Greeks were not
idolaters in the sense that they bowed down to
gold and ivory. They loved to chisel in marble
the beautiful forms that represented to them
their gods who dwelt on Mount Olympus. A
characteristic of the Greeks of this period was
that, in their art, they always presented their
goddesses fully clothed and, almost always, their
gods in the nude.</p>
<p>While the origin of the Parthenon has the
most of its roots firmly fixed in Egypt, many of
the sculptures were derived from the Assyrians.
Particularly is this true of the smaller figures,
winged mythical creatures, as well as lions and
horses, typical of the Assyrian bas-reliefs. The
heavier figures, notably those of the pediments,
are essentially Greek.</p>
<p>In the life and times of Phidias, a love for the
beautiful was so general that it was comparable
to the air which they breathed. It was not difficult,
therefore, for him to find men, almost as
accomplished as himself, upon whose shoulders
he could lay the greater part of the work.</p>
<p>It is a matter of keen regret that so few of
the sculptures of the Parthenon have been preserved.
For this reason, the most difficult problem
in the task of the reproduction of the Parthenon
at Nashville was the reproduction of the
sculptures.</p>
<p>When the Parthenon was destroyed in 1687
the sculptures were blown off the temple and, to
a great extent, broken up by the explosion. As
already noted, only two of the pedimental
groups remain on the ruin, one on each pediment.
Plaster casts of these are now in the
British Museum. A much larger proportion of
the figures of the friezes remain on the ruin but
they are so badly damaged that identification is
practically impossible; this is especially true of
the Doric frieze.</p>

<p class="pcap">Interior Corridor, South Side, Showing Elgin Marbles</p>
</div>
<p>In 1801, after the fragments of the sculptures
had lain in the debris around the temple for approximately
one hundred and fifteen years, Lord
Elgin, Minister to Turkey from England, persuaded
the Turks, who had again conquered the
Greeks, to let him go to Athens and dig up all
the sculptures that he could find around the
ruins. He sold these fragments to the British
government, and they are now the most highly
prized possessions of the British Museum, known
as the Elgin Marbles.</p>
<p>It is popular in some quarters to criticize Lord
Elgin for his action in taking the fragments
from the Parthenon to England. Some have
gone so far as to say that he actually robbed the
temple of its sculptures. Unquestionably, the
correct view of the matter is that Lord Elgin did
the world a great service in salvaging the fragments
from the earth in which they had deteriorated
for many years and, but for him,
might have suffered greater injury.</p>
<p>In the west room of the Parthenon at Nashville
and along the corridors of the east room
may be seen casts which form the only complete
set of the pedimental sculptures outside of the
British Museum. Many isolated groups of these
may be found in America and in Europe, but
all of them may be seen only at Nashville. Here
they are mounted on wooden bases forming a
most interesting exhibit and were obtained
through the courtesy of the British Museum.</p>
<p>In the east room of the Parthenon at the west
end of the south corridor is the head of one of
Selene&rsquo;s steeds, considered by many as the finest
example of a horse&rsquo;s head in the world. Just
beyond, through the door at the end of the corridor,
is seen in the west room the figure of
Heracles. It is interesting to note that in the
report of the artists who passed on the value of
the Elgin marbles a statement was incorporated
to the effect that the back muscles of the
Heracles represented the finest example of
physiological art known to the world of that
day. Another most interesting group of sculptures,
the three Fates, is seen near by in the west
end of the east room. This group, thought to
be the work of Phidias, is generally regarded
as one of the most beautiful examples of sculptural
art existing today.</p>
<p>The casts of the Elgin marbles in the Parthenon
at Nashville, which were made by the
British Government, were not obtained primarily
as an exhibit but as a study for the reproduction
of those sculptures now on the
building. However, it was not thought inappropriate
to mount the fragments and use them
as an exhibit so as to permit visitors to compare
the completed figures with them. The comparison
can only cover approximately half the
figures on the pediments as the remainder have
been lost beyond recovery. Quite naturally,
the question arises in the mind of the reader as
to how it was possible for the artists to reproduce
all of them.</p>
<p>In 1674, just thirteen years before the explosion
which destroyed the Parthenon, young
Jacques Carrey, a French artist attached to the
French embassay to Turkey, on a voyage from
Paris to Constantinople with the ambassador
stopped off at Athens and sketched the temple
sculptures. These sketches are preserved in the
National Library at Paris and were made available
for the artists. From a study of the Elgin
marbles and the Carrey drawings, supplemented
by further study of Greek contemporary art and
Greek history, the artists at Nashville succeeded
in making a wonderful reproduction of the Parthenon&rsquo;s
sculptures.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figures from the Ionic Frieze</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">The Ionic and Doric Friezes</span></h2>
<p>The inner or Ionic frieze, sometimes erroneously
called <i>the</i> frieze, was one of the most
beautiful of the groups of sculptures on the
original Parthenon. It was almost unknown to
distinctly Doric temples and owes its place on
the Parthenon to some one or more Ionic temples
from which the idea was without doubt copied.</p>
<p>In the Ionic frieze is found most of the atmosphere
of ancient Assyria that is associated
with the Parthenon. This frieze was low in relief,
forty inches in height; and of necessity the
figures of the men and women and animals
which went to make up the frieze were small,
typical of the Assyrian bas-relief.</p>
<p>The Ionic frieze was located along the outer
walls of the Parthenon, extending forty inches
down from the top of the wall, and rested on a
blue fret running all around the building, a
distance of five hundred and twenty-four feet.
It was a marvelous piece of sculptural art. Although
there were approximately six hundred
figures in the frieze, men, women, and animals,
no two of them were alike&mdash;no two men, no two
women, and no two animals; yet all were graceful,
dignified, and beautiful.</p>
<p>The Ionic frieze of the Parthenon depicted the
Panathenaic Procession which occurred every
four years in Athens. It was an established part
of the Panathenaic Festival and coincident also
with the athletic contests held in honor of
Athena. On this occasion the Greeks assembled
in the downtown streets of Athens; men and
women of high and low degree with their slaves,
various kinds of animals, chariots with their
horsemen, men at arms, wild horses led by Barbarians,
dignitaries of state, and maidens. These
formed a procession which wound its way
up through the streets of Athens leading to the
Acropolis, on to that sacred hill, and into the
Parthenon, where they invested the figure of
Athena with a peplos, or robe, which had been
woven by the women of Athens during the previous
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
four-year period. It was at once a gala
and a solemn occasion for the Greeks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for lack of funds the Ionic
frieze has been left off the Parthenon at Nashville,
which lacks that much of being completed.
It is available, however, as the greater part of
it is in the British Museum, some in the Louvre,
and the remainder, twenty-four feet in all, is
still on the ruin at Athens. There is no doubt
that the Ionic frieze will eventually find its
place on the temple at Nashville.</p>
<p>The Doric, or outer frieze, is located on the
outside of the Parthenon above the architrave
that rests on the great Doric columns of the
peristyle. It extends along both sides of the
building and underneath the pedimental sculptures
at each end. It consists of a repeating
conventional design called a triglyph which divides
the frieze into ninety-two panels, each
panel containing a group of sculptures. The
panels with their sculptures are known as the
metopes and are approximately four feet square.</p>
<p>There were no repetitions in the sculptures of
the Doric frieze. They told legendary and
mythological stories that were dear to the heart
of the Greeks. That part of the frieze on the
eastern end of the building pictured scenes from
the struggle between the gods and the giants.
The war between the Greeks and the Amazons
was shown by the figures of the frieze on the
western end. On the north side of the building
the figures depicted incidents of the Trojan
War, while those along the south side told the
story of the Lapiths, a tribe of the Greeks, and
the Centaurs. The story is that of a princess of
this tribe who was to be married. She sent invitations
to the Centaurs, mythological creatures
part man and part horse, to come to the wedding
feast. They came, drank wine, became
drunken, and insulted the bride, which brought
on a war in which the Centaurs were defeated.</p>
<p>The figures of the Doric frieze are archaic and
stiff by comparison with those of the pedimental
sculptures or of the Ionic frieze and are therefore
thought not to be the work of Phidias and
his associates but rather a transfer from one of
the earlier temples to the Parthenon. They play
their part well in the harmonious whole and reflect
the ability and genius of Phidias, who
adapted them.</p>

<p class="pcap">The West Pediment Showing Section of Doric Frieze Underneath the Acroteria Above</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">The West Pediment</span></h2>
<p>The figures of the west pediment were more
easily reproduced than those of the east pediment,
as they were more completely authenticated
by the Elgin marbles and the Carrey drawings.</p>
<p>It should be understood that the explosion
that destroyed the Parthenon did its greatest
damage to the figures themselves rather than to
the base on which they rested, and as a consequence
less difficulty was encountered by the
artists in placing the sculptures in their proper
settings on the west than on the east pediment.
In considering the sculptures of the two pediments
it must also be borne in mind that the
force of the explosion was greatest in the eastern
portion of the building, as evidenced by the condition
of the ruin, and for that reason also the
greatest damage was to the east pediment.</p>
<p>The sculptures of the west pediment tell the
story of the struggle between Poseidon, the
powerful god of the sea, and his niece Athena,
the goddess of wisdom, for the possession of
Attica, or ancient Greece.</p>
<p>In the center of the pediment, to the right, is
the heroic figure of Poseidon with his three-pronged
weapon or trident in his hand, his
friends and supporters to the right. Opposing
him, and to the left, is the equally heroic figure
of Athena with her great spear in her hand, her
supporters to the left. Both of these gods
coveted the fair land of Attica and desired the
worship of its people. They were unable to
agree and appealed to the gods for a decision.
The gods held their convocation on the Acropolis,
the site of the Parthenon, and this assembly
is shown by the figures of the west pediment.</p>
<p>As a result of the convocation the gods decreed
that the contestant who should most bless
Greece would be given the control of Athens
and have the worship of the Greeks. It was to
be a battle of blessing, rather than blood.</p>
<p>Poseidon, in granting his blessing, struck the
solid rock of the Acropolis with his trident, and
as he was the god of the sea it obeyed him and
came up in a rushing, gushing spring of salt
water, symbolic of his promise that if the Greeks
would make him their god he would make of
them a mighty maritime nation&mdash;their glory
should be on the sea. When it became Athena&rsquo;s
turn to grant her blessing, she struck her great
spear in the earth and withdrew it and from the
place sprang an olive tree, the parent of all those
which have so greatly blessed Greece from that
day to this. The gods, acting wisely, decreed
that Athena&rsquo;s gift was of far greater advantage
to the Greeks than any promise of the glory of
war as made by Poseidon, and made her the
patron goddess of Athens.</p>

<p class="pcap">The East Pediment with Section of the Doric Frieze Underneath Showing Gryphon Monsters
and Acroteria on Roof</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">The East Pediment</span></h2>
<p>It would be very difficult for a visitor to
Nashville to decide which group of sculptures
on the Parthenon is the loveliest. Each general
group fits so harmoniously into its own particular
place that a choice of one could not avoid
being unfair to the others. Viewing the west
pediment first, one essaying judgment might exclaim,
&ldquo;What could be more beautiful!&rdquo; Yet on
leaving it and looking at the east pediment he
might easily be found saying, &ldquo;Here is the answer.&rdquo;
The presence on the east pediment of
the three Fates, the Heracles, and the steeds of
Selene probably gives the east pediment the
advantage over the other groups, especially in
the eyes of the artists.</p>
<p>The story of the east pediment is very beautiful
and tells of the birth of Athena and of her
reign. In the beginning Zeus, the father of the
gods, the king of the gods, had a very severe
headache and could find no relief. He had long
wanted a child born of the intellect. It is said
that he was so disappointed at having a son,
Hephaestus, born maimed that he threw him out
of Heaven and it took a whole day for him to
fall to the earth. Hephaestus was the god of
fire, the god of metals, the blacksmith of the
gods, and he forged the thunderbolts that Zeus
used in his battles of Heaven. Hephaestus sent
word to his father that if he would restore him
to his rightful position among the gods, he
would cure him of his headache. Thereupon
Zeus assembled the gods on Mount Olympus and
from somewhere, in a thundercloud, came
Hephaestus. He struck his father in the back
of the head with an axe and from the wound,
giving Zeus his wish, sprang Athena, fully
grown, clothed, and armed. She was announced
and crowned goddess of wisdom by Nike, goddess
of victory. It is said that at this event the
earth groaned, Mount Olympus trembled, and
the gods stood in amazement at the miracle that
had been performed. These four figures form
the highest pinnacle of the east pediment of the
Parthenon.</p>
<p>At the extreme south end of the pediment,
representing the beginning of the reign of
Athena, in the morning is seen Helios, the god
of the sun, the god of the morning, coming up
out of the sea driving his four steeds representing
the four seasons. As the horses come bounding
out of the sea, Helios can scarcely restrain
them, so eager are they to mount the skies.</p>
<p>Heracles, the next figure on the pediment,
is shown with his club on his shoulder, nonchalantly
looking at the horses, paying no attention
to what is taking place on Mount
Olympus. He is looking at the sun as it rises.
Heracles was known as the favorite of the gods.
In his early manhood they had permitted him
to choose between virtue on the one hand, and
vice on the other, both very attractively arrayed.
He chose virtue rather than vice, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
thus became their favorite. He did many heroic
deeds in Grecian history, and was the national
hero of Greece. Heracles was himself made a
god; Zeus was his father, his mother was a
mortal.</p>
<p>Next, on the pediment, may be seen the figures
of Demeter, the sister of Zeus, and her
daughter Persephone. Demeter was the goddess
of the seasons. Ceres was her Roman name,
and her daughter, Persephone, was the goddess
of the underworld. She became the goddess of
the underworld in this wise: One day when
Persephone was in the fields plucking violets
with her maidens, suddenly the earth opened and
through it, in a chariot, came Pluto, the god of
Hades. He saw her, fell in love with her, seized
her, took her back to Hades, and made her his
queen. Her mother grieved sorely and would
not be comforted. She had powerful influence
with the gods. She sent plagues on the earth
and worried the gods, until Zeus was forced to
compel Pluto to bring Persephone back to her
mother. Thereafter, it is said, under a compromise
agreement, Persephone spent six months
of each year with her mother among the gods,
and six months with her husband, Pluto, in
Hades.</p>
<p>The next figure on the pediment is that of
Iris, the female messenger of the gods, the rainbow
goddess. She is represented on the pediment
as being poised, ready to go at a moment&rsquo;s
notice, to tell the story of the birth of Athena to
the world. This is the first figure seen among the
fragments as the visitor enters the Parthenon
door, and is often confused with the Winged
Victory of Samothrace. The confusion arises
from the fact that in the fragment of the Parthenon
figure of Iris, located in the west room,
she is holding her scarf at arm&rsquo;s length in her
hands and the fragment is broken through the
scarf and through the arms, causing it to look
as if it might be a wing, when, as a matter of
fact, it is the fragment of a scarf and not a
wing; and the figure is not the Winged Victory,
but is Iris, the female messenger of the gods,
the rainbow goddess.</p>
<p>Next is seen on the pediment the figure
of Poseidon, the god of the sea; Neptune was
his Roman name. Poseidon was the brother of
Zeus, one of the chief deities of the Greeks, and
is represented on the east pediment as sitting
calmly by, looking on at what is taking place.</p>
<p>The next figure beyond Poseidon is that of
Aphrodite, or Venus, the goddess of beauty, the
goddess of love. She seems shocked at what
she sees, and shrinks a little; but is comforting
Hebe, the goddess of youth, who is reclining at
her feet, by placing her hand on her head.</p>
<p>Then comes the central group, Hephaestus,
Zeus, Nike, and Athena, or Minerva as the
Romans called her, illustrating the story of the
birth of Athena.</p>
<p>Next is seen Ares, or Mars, the god of war.
He is represented on the pediment as looking
rather sternly past Athena as though he does
not welcome this additional warlike member to
the family of the gods.</p>
<p>The next figure is that of Artemis, the twin
sister of Apollo. Artemis is the goddess of the
fields, the goddess of hunting; Diana is her Roman
name. She is represented on the pediment
as shading her eyes with her hand from the resplendent
glory of the newborn goddess.</p>
<p>Just beyond Artemis is seen Hera, queen of
Heaven, also known as Juno, the jealous wife
of Zeus. In addition to her jealousy, it is said
that she was vain and the peacock, seen near by,
was sacred to her. Hera was also the goddess of
maternity, and very fittingly was present at the
birth of Athena.</p>
<p>The next figure is that of Hermes, the male
messenger of the gods, corresponding to Iris,
the female messenger. Iris usually executed the
commands and carried the messages for Hera,
while Hermes performed a like office for Zeus.
He is always represented with a magic wand, or
caduceus, in his hand, which was given to him
by Apollo. One day, when Hermes was a mere
child, almost a baby, he was playing in the fields
and captured a tortoise. He placed strings
across the shell of the tortoise and made a
musical instrument (we call it the lyre), and
presented it to his brother Apollo. Apollo, who
was the god of music, was so delighted with the
precociousness of his baby brother that he gave
him the magic wand, which had the power of
putting gods and mortals to sleep at his will.
Hermes is also shown with wings on his ankles
and wings on his cap. He was god of business,
and also the god of transportation. His figure
adorns many of the railway stations of the
world. His Roman name is Mercury.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Beyond Hermes, on the pediment, is seen
Apollo, the god of music, with his harp. He
was also the god of manly youth and the god of
healing. Esculapius, his son, was the first doctor
of Greece, the father of all the physicians.
Apollo was regarded as the most beautiful of
the gods. Reclining on him is seen Ganymede,
the cupbearer of the gods.</p>
<p>These were the chief deities of the Greeks.
There were others which they worshiped also.
They were as sacred to the ancient Greek as Jehovah
is to us, and it is pertinent to say that
they worshiped the beautiful&mdash;and the beautiful
is the spiritual.</p>
<p>We are not so much interested in the gods of
the Greeks in this twentieth century, however,
as we are in human life; and the next group of
figures to Apollo and Ganymede, the three Fates,
brings the Whole matter closer to us, because it
represents the Greek idea of life. The first figure
in the group is Clotho, who is represented as
spinning the thread of life; and as she spins, the
second figure, Lachesis, winds it on a spool, and
the third figure, Atropos, clips it at will, typifying
the beginning, the span, and the end of life&mdash;the
destiny of us all.</p>
<p>Last, in the extreme north angle of the pediment,
in the evening, is seen the gentle Selene,
the goddess of the moon, the goddess of the
evening, guiding her tired steeds, so different
from those seen coming out of the sea in the
morning, down into the cool, quiet waters of
the deep, typifying not alone the close of the
day but the close of the reign of Athena and
the end of time.</p>
<p>The gods of the Greeks are no more. They
have no single worshiper left on all the face of
the earth today to pay them homage, yet their
deeds are told in song and story, and their
memory is green in the hearts of those who love
the beautiful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>And now, we come to the close of the story
of the Parthenon.</p>
<p>The period of Pericles marked one of the high
points in the history of the world. A comparison
of its characteristics serves to emphasize its
superiority over other epochs in many ways.
The Parthenon at Athens was not merely a wonderful
building, but was an expression of Greek
mind and heart. It did not spring up in a day
as did Athena from the head of Zeus but found
its roots in the prehistoric altars of their goddess.
It was not built to please individuals but to
honor their gods. It is no wonder, then, that
when the Parthenon came into full flower in the
&ldquo;Age of Pericles&rdquo; it should have reached that
state which the judgment of succeeding generations
has pronounced perfection.</p>
<p>The Parthenon at Nashville stands alone as a
portrayal of the Parthenon of Pericles. It
would be too much of a challenge to the
antiquity of the Parthenon to say that every
statement made about it in these pages bears the
stamp of absolute authenticity. It can be said,
however, that because of the many facts obtained
from the research and the records of
earlier days and because of the eleven years of
research and study in our own times, the Parthenon
at Nashville will stand as the last word.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate the influence of the
Parthenon at Nashville on the world of today.
To those who love the beautiful, either by instinct
or cultivation, the Parthenon is a thing
to be revered; to others it is just another building.
To understand and appreciate the Parthenon
it must be studied. We may glance at some
buildings and pass on, but not so with the Parthenon.
It is compelling. A revelation of its
balanced lines and its harmony of proportions,
its simplicity both delicate and strong, its subtleties,
some bordering on the mystical, marks the
Parthenon as a thing by itself.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Naos or East Room as Seen Through the Eastern Doors</p>
</div>
<p>The Parthenon is used only for educational
and cultural purposes. Over four hundred college,
high school, and primary school groups
visit the Parthenon each year.</p>
<p>This, then, may be said of the Parthenon:
As in the earlier days, even so now, young and
old, rich and poor, alike are made happy by its
sheer beauty and inspired by its history to reach
for a higher and better life.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
